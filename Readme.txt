AirLV - Open Source Air Purifier, Large

Build your own clean air

The AirLV is an Open Source air purifier, it comprises of box filter's and an extractor fan. The design's main feature is the enclosure system which accomodates a variety of filter sizes and stacking setups. The goal was to develop an affordable easy to build air purifier where the user isn't locked into any one filter dimention. The large size allows a large extractor fan to be used moving around 1000 cubic meters of air per hour.

This concept design continues to evolve as we learn more about our user requirements. Join us and build your own clean air.
